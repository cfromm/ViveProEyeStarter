# ViveProEyeStarter
 Basic environment for getting started with the ViveProEye
 
Uses Unity 2019 with legacy SteamVR (no interaction system) which could be easily upgraded without loss of functionality if you so desire.

To view gaze vectors in the Scene window, toggle "Gizmos" on in the top right corner of the Scene window (Note that these will not be visible inside the HMD)
